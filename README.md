# Kagi Redirect

A WIP browser extension that redirects Google searches to Kagi. Uses the [`declarativeNetRequest` WebExtensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/declarativeNetRequest) for (hopefully) optimal reliability.

To enable searches in private browsing, grab the session link from your [Kagi account settings](https://kagi.com/settings?p=user_details) and paste it into the extension options page. Don't forget to enable the allow in private browsing setting on the extension as well.
